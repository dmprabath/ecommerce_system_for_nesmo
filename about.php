	Here at <a href="nesmosystem.lk">www.nesmo.lk</a> , we believe that having access to healthy clean water is essential for having a healthy and prosperous life. It’s a known fact that a human should drink at least 2 liters of water each day, going up to 16 liters when living in a warm climate, but the quality of the water is also very important.</p>
	<p>

	Whether you’re connecting to a municipal water source, or you’re using a well, the quality of the water you drink can be improved. Unlike the filtration systems used in the past, modern water filters are small and easy to use. Whether you choose a reverse osmosis system or a simpler faucet-mounted one, the water you drink will be cleaner and healthier.</p><p>

	There are many types of water filters you can use, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This is why we developed informative buying guides to help you in choosing the right type for your household.
	</p><p>
	Consuming filtered water is not only better for you, but it’s also better for the environment. When you filter your running water, you don’t have to buy bottled mineral water. This lowers your carbon footprint because you’re consuming less plastic, and the water doesn’t have to be delivered by trucks to you.</p><p>

	There are many advantages of using filtered water. Besides being healthier when you drink it, filtered water is also better for your skin and hair if you use it when you’re washing. We’re certain that after reading our comprehensive buying guides, you’ll be able to make an informed decision about which is the most suitable water filter pitcher for your home.
